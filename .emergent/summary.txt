<analysis>original_problem_statement:
The user wants to build a full-stack petition website named Saaf Hawa (Clean Air) to address the air pollution crisis in Delhi, India.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Frontend:**
    *   A visually appealing landing page with a clear call-to-action (Sign the Petition).
    *   Use specific, authentic images of Delhi's air pollution (smog-covered landmarks, people in masks, traffic in smog).
    *   Implement specific fonts requested by the user: Poppins for English headings, Inter for English body text, Hind for Hindi headings.
    *   The Sign Now button in the header should anchor/scroll to the signature form.
    *   The website must be fully mobile-responsive without any horizontal overflow.
    *   Remove the Made with Emergent watermark.
    *   The project name should be Saaf Hawa, not Saaf Hawa Abhiyan.
    *   The success page should not have a photo.

2.  **Backend & Functionality:**
    *   A signature form that collects the user's Name and Phone Number (Email should be optional/removed).
    *   Store signatures permanently in a MongoDB database.
    *   Upon successful submission, the user should be redirected to a success page.
    *   The user must be able to download a verified, signed copy of the petition in both PDF and image formats.
    *   The downloaded PDF should have a specific title (CLEAN AIR! MY RIGHT) and should not contain Hindi text. The design should be simple and professional (not colorful).

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a React frontend and FastAPI backend. The application serves as a petition website for the Saaf Hawa campaign. It features a hero section, a problem description section with images, and a signature form. The backend uses MongoDB to store signatures and is capable of generating downloadable PDF and image files of the signed petition. The application has undergone multiple iterations of UI/UX refinement based on user feedback regarding fonts, images, colors, and mobile responsiveness.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The user reported an issue with a cut-off image in the Problem Statement section and requested to revert the recently added colorful design of the downloadable PDF back to its previous, simpler black-and-white version. The agent has written the code to fix the image layout in  and reverted the PDF generation logic in .
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? backend testing agent
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1: Verify the latest fixes for the image layout and PDF design (P0)

  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - Attempted fixes: The agent has modified  to fix the image grid and  to revert the PDF to a non-colorful design. However, these changes have not been tested or verified.
     - Next debug checklist: 
        1. Restart the backend server using backend: stopped
backend: started to apply the changes in .
        2. Use the screenshot tool to visually inspect the Problem Statement section on the homepage to confirm the third image is no longer cut off.
        3. Perform an end-to-end test: submit the petition form, navigate to the success page, and download the PDF.
        4. Open the downloaded PDF to confirm it has been reverted to the simple, non-colorful design and does not contain Hindi text.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? To address the user's direct feedback on visual bugs and design preferences, making the website production ready.
     - Status:  IN PROGRESS
     - Is recurring issue? N
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? both
     - Blocked on other issue: None

**In progress Task List**:
  None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
The primary goal is to achieve a production ready state by resolving all user-reported issues. There are no other outstanding future tasks.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Full-Stack Application**: Built the petition website from scratch.
- **Backend**: Implemented signature storage (MongoDB), and dynamic generation of downloadable PDFs and images (, ).
- **Frontend**: Created all necessary components (, , , , ) and pages (, ).
- **UI/UX Iteration**:
    - Refined color schemes to a black-and-white theme.
    - Implemented user-specified fonts (Poppins, Inter, IBM Plex Serif, etc.) over multiple iterations.
    - Replaced generic images with authentic photos of Delhi's air pollution as requested.
- **Functionality Adjustments**:
    - Changed the project name from Saaf Hawa Abhiyan to Saaf Hawa.
    - Modified the signature form to make the email field optional and then remove it entirely.
    - Implemented smooth scrolling from the header Sign Now button to the form.
- **Technical Fixes**:
    - Achieved full mobile responsiveness, resolving horizontal overflow issues.
    - Removed the Made with Emergent watermark from .

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None. The agent has addressed all previously mentioned issues.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - Issue recurrence in previous fork: None
  - Recurrence count: 0
  - Status: NA

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend**: React, , TailwindCSS,  for icons.
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, Pydantic for data validation.
-   **Database**: MongoDB (via  async driver) for storing petition signatures.
-   **File Generation**:  library for creating PDFs,  (PIL) for creating images from text and petition data.
-   **Deployment/Service Mgt**: Services are managed by .

**key DB schema**
-   ** collection**:
    -   uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root):  (UUID)
    -   : 
    -   : 
    -   :  (Optional, currently not collected)
    -   : 

**changes in tech stack**
-  and  were added to the backend to support PDF and image generation.

**All files of reference**
-   : Recently edited to fix an image layout issue.
-   : Recently edited to revert the PDF design to a simpler version.
-   : Edited to remove the watermark and set the page title.
-   : Modified multiple times to change form fields and styling.
-   : Modified to make the  field optional.
-   : Contains custom fonts and global styles.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
None critical, but many responsive styles are implemented directly in components using Tailwind's , , etc. prefixes. Some could be consolidated for easier maintenance, but it's not a priority.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Creates a new signature.
-   : Retrieves petition statistics (total signatures).
-   : Gets a list of recent signatures.
-   : Downloads the petition as a PDF.
-   : Downloads the petition as a PNG image.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The user is highly detail-oriented and provides feedback iteratively, often with screenshots. Always verify visual changes with the screenshot tool before concluding a task.
-   Production ready is the user's key requirement. This means no visual glitches, full mobile responsiveness, and all features working as requested.
-   The user has very specific tastes for images and fonts. Do not deviate from the latest set of approved visuals.
-   The backend must be restarted (backend: stopped
backend: started) after any changes to its Python files for the changes to take effect.

-   **Mocked**: No functionality is currently mocked.

**3rd Party Integrations**:
None.

**Testing status**
  - Testing agent used after significant changes: YES
  - Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
  - Test files created: []

**Credentials to test flow:**
N/A

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent implemented fixes for the user's latest request (fixing a cut-off image and reverting PDF design) but did not restart the backend server or run any tests (screenshot or end-to-end) to verify that the fixes were successful. The immediate next step is to run backend: stopped
backend: started and then test the changes.</analysis>
